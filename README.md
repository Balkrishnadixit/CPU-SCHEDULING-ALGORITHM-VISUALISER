# CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHM VISUALISER

## Introduction <br>

The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to interactively visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms. This project aims to provide an educational resource for understanding how different scheduling algorithms work internally and their effects on the execution of processes in a CPU. <br>

## Features <br>
- Interactive visualization of CPU scheduling algorithms
- Support for the following algorithms ðŸ‘‡
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin Scheduling (RRS)
- Longest Job First (LJF)
- Priority CPU Scheduling
- Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Real-time updates to process queues, timelines, and statistics
- User-friendly interface for adjusting algorithm parameters
- Clear visualization of process execution, arrival times, waiting times, and more
